  "subtitle": "Not all AI-powered development platforms can build Lightning Login applications",

    "title": "What is 'Vibe Coding'?",
    "description": "Vibe coding refers to AI-powered development platforms that allow developers to build applications through conversational interfaces, prompts, and rapid iteration—emphasizing speed and developer experience over traditional coding workflows. These platforms range from frontend-only generators to full-stack development environments.",
    "examples": [
      "Conversational interfaces that generate complete applications from descriptions",
      "AI-powered platforms that handle infrastructure setup automatically",
      "Rapid prototyping tools that go from idea to deployed app in minutes",

    "title": "Why Lightning Login Needs a Real Server",
    "description": "The LNURL-auth protocol's security model is incompatible with edge-only architectures. Here's why:",
    "requirements": [
      {
        "requirement": "Stateful k1 Challenge Storage",
        "reason": "The server must generate and temporarily store k1 challenges (32-byte random hex strings) with 5-minute expiration. These challenges must be retrievable when the wallet makes the callback. Edge functions are stateless and reset between invocations—they cannot persist data across requests without external storage.",
        "technical": "k1 challenges need in-memory storage (Map/Set) or a persistent KV store (Redis, Upstash). Edge functions lack both unless explicitly configured with external services."
      },
      {
        "requirement": "Session Cookie Management",
        "reason": "After signature verification, the server creates an httpOnly session cookie containing the user's public key. This session must persist across page reloads and multiple requests. Edge functions can set cookies, but session persistence typically requires a database or KV store to track active sessions.",
        "technical": "While edge functions can set cookies, validating sessions across requests requires either a database lookup or a stateful backend that can maintain session state."
      },
      {
        "requirement": "Cryptographic Operations",
        "reason": "Signature verification uses Node.js crypto primitives (ECDSA with secp256k1). While some edge runtimes support crypto APIs, many have limited support for the specific elliptic curve operations required by LNURL-auth.",
        "technical": "The lnurl npm package relies on Node.js crypto APIs. Edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions) have limited crypto support and may require polyfills or alternative libraries."
      },
      {
        "requirement": "Real-Time Status Polling",
        "reason": "The frontend polls /api/auth/status to detect when authentication completes. This endpoint must query the k1 challenge store and check session cookies. Edge functions can handle this, but only if backed by a persistent store—otherwise they cannot track login state across invocations.",
        "technical": "Status polling requires reading from the k1 challenge store (in-memory Map or external KV) and checking session cookies. Pure edge functions cannot maintain the in-memory store needed for this."
      }
    ],
    "summary": "Lightning Login fundamentally requires a stateful backend—either a traditional server (Node.js, Express, Next.js on a server) or a serverless architecture backed by persistent storage (Redis, PostgreSQL, KV stores). Pure edge functions without external persistence cannot implement the protocol correctly."
